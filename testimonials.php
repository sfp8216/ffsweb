         difficult the subject, she always makes sure I know it in

        I recently had the pleasure of working with Dr. Stein as my math
        tutor. As an adult learner with very specific needs and a tight
        time frame, I was looking for a teacher who could adapt to my
        learning style. After seeing a couple of different tutors,
        it was clear Dr. Stein was the right choice. I feel my work
        with her was the main reason I was able to complete my tasks
        so well.

        Dr. Stein, my tutor, has helped me through two maths, algebra
        and geometry, and now chemistry.  She has been the best tutor
        I’ve ever had.  I’m not very bright in mathematics, but
        with her help, I’ve passed all my Regents.  Thanks.

        Is there someone out there with a clear understanding of math and science?
        Is there someone out there with excellent teaching skills and a pleasant
        personality?  The answer is yes.  Dr. Stein is her name and tutoring
        is her game.  Over the past year and a half, Dr. Stein has helped
        me get a clear understanding of math and science and has helped
        me do well on my Regents.  I highly recommend her.

        Dr. Stein is by far the best tutor that I have had and
        without her, I probably wouldn’t have a chance at passing
        the algebra Regents.

        A wonderful tutor, dedicated and caring, who knows the material
        and teaches it wonderfully, from biology to algebra, geometry,
        or chemistry. Whatever it may be, Dr. Stein is the best by far!</li>
