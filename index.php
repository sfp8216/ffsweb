<h2 class='title-head'>Who we are</h2>
 <p>
 Frank â€˜N Stein and Son, LLC, is a privately-owned academic tutoring company.
 In addition to offering standardized test preparation (SAT/ACT/TEAS/TASC/GED),
 we offer tutoring in Regents math (both CommonCore and traditional pre-algebra,
 algebra 1, geometry, algebra 2/trigonometry), pre-calculus, calculus, AP Calculus,
 Regents science (biology, chemistry, and physics), AP Physics B, and English
 for grades 6 through adult.   A number of our students are adults who are
 seeking to improve their writing skills or prepare for standardized testing
 as part of a career change (such as preparing for the TEAS test for nursing school).
 We also provide reading, writing, and conversational skills for ESL students
 and assistance in writing and editing college application essays.

<h2 class='title-head'>Our Philosophy</h2>
<p>
Because we are a small, privately-owned company, we are not bound to follow a
corporate academic program.  All of our tutoring is one-on-one, and every
lesson is tailored to the needs of the individual student.  Our business
philosophy is to treat every student as if he or she were our only student.
